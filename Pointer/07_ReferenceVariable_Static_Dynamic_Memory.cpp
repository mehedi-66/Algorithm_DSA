/*
    ************** Reference Variable Static and Dynamic Memory **********

    //********* when we use stack memory that called static memory allocation:
    //********* when we use Heap memory that called Dynamic memory allocation:

    1) Reference Variable ==> one person has two name ==> same memory but different different name

    create reference Variable:
    int i = 5;
    int & j = i;

    i and j ===> indicate same memory location:

    ******* Why we use reference variable
    // pass by value and pass by reference ===> in case of pass by reference we use ===> reference variable:

    update(int &a, int b){}  ==> here a is pass by reference and b is pass by value


    ********* Array

        int arr[n]; ===> it is bad practice (because array size have to know in compile time)

        memory ===> stack + heap

        when we give value in run time by user ===> stack memory is smaller then the user requirement that time program will crashed
        that is why it is a bad practice


    ********** How we create large size memory : Dynamic memory Allocation
    Heap Memory create and linking

    new ===> keyword

    new char;

    it return address of heap memory ( because heap memory we do not allowed to give name of variable )

    // pointer store address

    char * ch = new char;

    memory view:
    point by address

    stack [  ch(710) ] ------------ heap [   710  ]
